            <p class="lead">  Drawbacks: Although the personal computer has helped make life much easier, it has also brought in a negative effect that isn't good for productivity. Distractions, with an endless stream of entertainment, it is hard to get work done. An example of this, while working on this project I have gotten distracted around 7-8 times. It is hard to focus and be productive when you are surrounded by technology that steals your attention.

            <p class="lead">  Importance: The personal computer was an invention that pioneered into a new frontier, the digital age where, almost everything is digital, shrinking the huge mainframes into desk sized computers, all the way into a phone that can fit in your pocket.
