            <h2>Origins</h2>
            <p class="lead">  The personal computer era started with DIY (do it yourself) computers that resembled a metal box with lights and switches on it, no screen, no keyboard, and especially no mouse. An example of one of these computers was the MIT Altair 8800, pictured below. This was the start of the personal computer industry, even though these were for electronic hobbyists. The computer industry quickly exploded only 2 years later with the Apple II, the TRS-80, and the Commodore PET.

            <h2>Updates & Upgrades</h2>
            <p class="lead">  Personal computers started as DIY projects with very little usability, but over time, personal computers became more usable and accessible to individuals. The personal computers gained a lot of power since its internals all got upgraded making them more capable of a wider variety of tasks. As computers became more power, their user interfaces became easier to use and quicker to learn, this then made computers accesible to a larger variety of people, such as people who are not "tech savvy." As more people use computers and see how useful they are, the more the computer industry will grow and prosper releasing and selling new computers every year, that computer always better than the last. Each year, new features, new uses, better graphics, better sound, this made computers able to do even more things and be even more useful.
